//**Cause:
//Using the call opcode without checking the return value.

//**Attributes:
//The CALL opcode is often used to transfer ether to an address. If the CALL fails it will not revert the contract
//but will return false. both the address.call() and address.send() methods use the CALL opcode. The example presented
//is of a contract which does not check the return value of address.send(). This send represents a change in the contract
//state. paidout is set to true after the send is made, assuming that the winnings have been paid out. This can be abused
//if the addressee causes the send to fail. This sets paidout to true and the balance of the contract remains the same.

//**Consequences:
//If a contractâ€™s state is changed when the call opcode is used, then the state of the contract can be manipulated by
//the addressee of the call.
